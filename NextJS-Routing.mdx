# Introduction

Next.js is a powerful framework for building server-rendered React applications. One of its standout features is its flexible routing system, which allows developers to create dynamic routes and handle API requests seamlessly. In this article, we'll dive into the world of Next.js app routing and explore how to leverage API route handlers effectively.

## Dynamic Routes

Next.js provides an elegant way to create dynamic routes by using square brackets in your file names. For example:

- `/pages/blog/[slug].js` will match any URL like `/blog/my-awesome-post`.
- You can access the `slug` parameter using `useRouter()` or `getServerSideProps()`.

## API Routes

API routes in Next.js allow you to create serverless endpoints within your app. These endpoints can handle requests from both the client and server sides. Here's how to set up an API route:

1. Create a new file under the `/pages/api` directory (e.g., `/pages/api/posts.js`).
2. Define your API logic inside the exported function.
3. Access request data using `req` and send a response using `res`.

Example API route for fetching blog posts:

```javascript
// pages/api/posts.js

export default async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const posts = await fetchPostsFromDatabase();
    res.status(200).json(posts);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" });
  }
};
```

## Handling API Requests

Next.js API routes allow you to handle various types of requests:

- GET: Fetch data from the server.
- POST: Send data to the server (e.g., form submissions).
- PUT and DELETE: Update or delete data.
- Remember to validate input data, handle errors gracefully, and secure your API routes.

## Conclusion

Next.js app routing, combined with API route handlers, empowers developers to build robust and efficient applications. Whether youâ€™re creating dynamic pages or handling API requests, Next.js provides a seamless experience for both developers and users.

Happy coding!
